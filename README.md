# -Image captioning for remote sensing data !
Welcome to the Remote Sensing Image Captioning Dataset (RSICD) challenge! This unique dataset offers a rich collection of over 10,000 diverse remotely sensed images, standardized to 224x224 pixels. Each image comes with five descriptive captions, providing a robust foundation for training and evaluating image captioning models.

Objective:
Develop a cutting-edge image captioning model capable of generating accurate and descriptive captions for remote sensing images. Focus should be on leveraging the RSICD dataset and handling the unique characteristics of remote sensing imagery.

Image data is provided in byte-array format and must be converted into images before applying ML techniques. VGG16 model was used by us !

Evaluation Metric:
The BLEU score : 0.52
